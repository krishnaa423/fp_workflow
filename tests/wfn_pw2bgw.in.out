     Parallel version (MPI), running on     1 processors

     MPI processes distributed on     1 nodes
     29708 MiB available memory on the printing compute node when the environment starts
 

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./tmp/struct.save/

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
